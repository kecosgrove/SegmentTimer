;Calculating frames from timestamps
;
;Settings:
;SET-FPS: takes a number and sets it as the working FPS (default is 60)
;SET-OUT-FORMAT: takes either the string "seconds" or the string "frames" (default is "frames")
;CHECK-FPS: takes no inputs and returns the FPS the program is using to round and calculate frames
;CHECK-OUT-FORMAT: takes no inputs and returns the unit the program is calculating time in.
;
;Functions:
;FROM-TO: takes any two times in seconds, returns the duration between them.
;LOADLESS: takes a list of times in seconds of even length. Every other interval is added and returned. RTA time is printed.
;LONGFORM-FROM-TO: takes 2 lists of length 1 2 or 3 where the last element is seconds, the second to last is minutes and
;                  the third to last is hours. Calculates the difference between them.
;LONGFORM-LOADLESS: takes a list of lists like those described above.
;
