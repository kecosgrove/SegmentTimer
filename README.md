SegmentTimer
============

Simple Scheme calculator for timing video segments, rounding approximate timestamps to exact frame values, subtracting loads and giving RTA and loadless time in several formats.

Open and run the RunMe.txt file in the same directory as SegmentTimer.txt and gui.txt.

I recommend running this program in DrScheme 4.2.1 using the Full Swindle Language:
